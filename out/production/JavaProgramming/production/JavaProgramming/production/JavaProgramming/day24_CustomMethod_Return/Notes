What's return method?


return method: return type is not void
				MUST return a vlaue


return statement: used for exiting the method
				 we can use it for returning a value from return methods


branching statements:
	continue: skiping the current iteration
	break: exits the loop or switch
	return: exiting the method (one method, current method)
	System.exit(0): exits the system (EVERY THING WILL BE TERMINATED)
